# Static Generation in DevTrack

This document explains how static generation is implemented in the DevTrack
project.

## What is Static Generation?

Static Generation is a rendering method in Next.js where HTML is generated at
build time and reused for each request. This results in faster page loads and
better SEO.

## Implementation Details

We've implemented static generation for the following dynamic routes:

1. **Project Detail Pages** (`/projects/[id]`)
2. **Project Edit Pages** (`/projects/edit/[projectId]`)
3. **Team Member Profile Pages** (`/profile/[id]`)

### Key Features

1. **Selective Static Generation**

   - Only the most recent 20 projects/team members are pre-rendered at build
     time
   - This optimizes build time while still providing static generation for the
     most commonly accessed content

2. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**

   - Pages are revalidated every hour (`revalidate: 3600`)
   - This ensures content stays fresh without requiring a full rebuild

3. **Dynamic Fallback**

   - `dynamicParams: true` enables server-side rendering for paths not generated
     at build time
   - This ensures all content is accessible, even if it wasn't pre-rendered

4. **Enhanced Loading States**
   - Skeleton loaders provide a better user experience during page transitions
   - Error handling for cases where content doesn't exist or can't be loaded

## Code Example

```tsx
// Generate static params for all projects at build time
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const projects = await api.project.getAllProjects();

  // Only generate static pages for the most recent 20 projects to optimize build time
  return projects
    .sort(
      (a, b) =>
        new Date(b.createdAt).getTime() - new Date(a.createdAt).getTime(),
    )
    .slice(0, 20)
    .map((project) => ({
      id: project.id.toString(),
    }));
}

// Enable ISR with a revalidation period of 1 hour
export const revalidate = 3600; // seconds

// Enable dynamic rendering for paths not generated at build time
export const dynamicParams = true;
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Performance**: Pre-rendered pages load faster
2. **Better SEO**: Search engines can index static content more effectively
3. **Reduced Server Load**: Fewer server-side renders are needed
4. **Enhanced User Experience**: Pages appear to load instantly
5. **Resilience**: Static pages can be served from a CDN even if the backend is
   down

## Future Improvements

1. **Sitemap Generation**: Automatically generate a sitemap from static paths
2. **Prefetching**: Implement prefetching for linked content
3. **Analytics Integration**: Track which static pages are most frequently
   accessed
4. **Custom 404 Pages**: Create more helpful 404 pages for non-existent content
